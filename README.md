# IBM-Cloud-ML-Project
The predictive maintenance model was successfully developed using Random Forest Classifier, utilizing features like Air temperature, Torque, Rotational Speed, and Tool Wear.
The model accurately predicts the type of failure in industrial machines,based on the give inputs.
Deployment on IBM Watson Studio ensured scalability and accessibility with real-time prediction along with the confidence level in percentages .
Challenges faced included maintaining model performance during deployment.
Overall, the solution demonstrates how machine learning and cloud platforms can drive cost-effective and reliable industrial operations.
